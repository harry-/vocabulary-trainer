floating point exception after trying to introduce different scoresheets (and also deleting the old scoresheet "score")


issues

quiz.out -q 3 does not work (should it? check getopt_long documentation)

todo

create c only version (ctime is c++)
make databases chooseable (needs distinct scoresheets per db)
